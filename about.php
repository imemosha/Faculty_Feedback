				<br>

				<p>It is a new concept in the Education System of Nepal, that can actually help the students review their 
				faculties using their unique ID and Passwords. The system allows the students to actually go into depths of their
				faculty teachers and rank them based on various criterias. The aim of the system is to allow the students to
				ethically analyse how the teacher performs so that the quality of their education can improve. The educational institute can also review how the teacher has been performing in order to develop or motivate them into doing better.</p><br>
